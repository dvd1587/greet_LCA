# LCA Model - Natural Gas Transportation - GREET

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a simple LCA that calculates the carbon footprint in the transportation of natural gas through pipelines and as LNG employing the GREET model. 
<br />

<h2>Tools/Applications Used</h2>

- <b>GREET</b> 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

[Greenhouse Gases Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Transportation](https://greet.anl.gov/files/2011ws-overview-lca) aka the GREET model was developed in 1996 by the Argonne National Laboratory. The GREET LCA model uses more than 100+ fuel production pathways from various energy feedstocks. It measures the inputs, outputs, and environmental impacts of a fuel product system throughout its lifecycle (well to wheels).

The GREET model works by defining the product and its production system, determining the inputs and outputs of such a system, which are products, materials, and energy, and then simulating processes that convert input to output.

<h2>Goal and scope definition:</h2>

For our purposes, weâ€™ll be simulating a version of well-to-pump fuel cycle for the comparison between LNG and pipelines as the GREET model specifically caters to the LCA of fuel in transportation and not exactly fuel transportation. The GREET model especially utilizes EPA methodologies and data, for performing GHG analysis of specific energy systems. This document covers three simulations using the GREET model:
1. Transportation of natural gas from a location in North America to an export terminal in Louisiana (using pipelines)
2. Liquefaction of natural gas and transportation from Louisiana to Germany (using LNG tanker)
